# Project goal
The aim is to move a mobile robot "turtlebot3" equipped with a RGB camera to follow  path tracking to a target with minimum distance using visual servoing techniques by calculating the pose of the camera and the error.
 
 # Requirement 
- Turtlebot3: It is the newest generational mobile robot. It is a basic model to use AutoRace packages for autonomous driving on ROS. For this project, the TurtleBot3 Burger (with packages installed on it) was  provided by our university https://condorcet.u-bourgogne.fr/en.  The main components are shown below:
